# Tower-Of-Hanoi
A simple Tower of Hanoi game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Drag and drop disks on needle-like towers following game rules: only move one disk at a time, and no larger disk on smaller. Responsive design with validation and win alert. Great for learning drag-and-drop and DOM manipulation.
